## Development on GDBlocks for Godot 3.x has been deprecated in favour of Goshapes for Godot 4.0
Thanks to various improvements in Godot 4.0, even in alpha, I've decided
to move development across, and renamed the project to suit its new purpose.

# GDBlocks for Godot 3.x
## Spline-modelling Addon for Godot

GDBlocks is a work in progress - use in projects at your own risk.

GDBlocks is a work in progress project aimed to make level building in Godot a
bit easier. 

GDBlocks wraps wall geometry around splines in Godot using CSG.

It's implemented as an addon in GDScript. It works reasonably well but could
use some optimisation.
